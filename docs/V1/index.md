# Version 1.x

## Introduction

Version 1 was written to replace Stuart Herbert's `phix/contractlib` ContractLib library. It provides the same functionality, with an updated approach to the way that the exceptions are defined.

## Key Ideas

The key ideas in Version 1 are:

* support the `require` -> `do` -> `ensure` workflow of programming by contract

## Components

Version 1 ships with the following components:

Namespace | Purpose
----------|--------
[`GanbaroDigital\Contracts\V1\Contracts`](Contracts/index.html) | classes for enforcing design contracts
[`GanbaroDigital\Contracts\V1\Exceptions`](Exceptions/index.html) | exceptions thrown by this library

Click on the namespace to learn more about the classes in that component.
